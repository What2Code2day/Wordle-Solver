# Wordle-Solver
A simple Wordle solver I made in Python

1) open up the python file in cmd,
2) in [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) put in your first guess
3) enter the first letter from your word into the first input box
4) select the corresponding color (Yellow = y, Green = g, Grey = b)
5) then enter in the position of the letter (1-5)
6) after repeating this process for all the letters, you will see the only possible words in the list.

Hope you enjoy! :)
